## Project Title
MentorshipTokens: Tokens for Mentoring New Learners

## Project Description
MentorshipTokens is a decentralized smart contract that allows mentors to reward learners with tokens as an incentive for learning. The idea behind the project is to create an ecosystem that encourages and rewards knowledge-sharing and guidance. Mentors (or the contract owner) can distribute tokens to learners based on their mentorship or educational support.

This system will help incentivize experts and experienced individuals to engage with new learners, providing educational guidance, resources, and mentorship.

## Project Vision
The goal of MentorshipTokens is to create a self-sustaining, decentralized ecosystem where:
- Mentors are incentivized to provide educational guidance to new learners.
- Learners are encouraged to engage and complete their learning journeys.
- Tokens earned through mentorship can be traded, saved, or reinvested into the learning process.

This vision extends to building a robust, trustless platform that fosters knowledge sharing and incentivizes active participation in education. By incorporating token rewards, we aim to create an engaging system for both mentors and learners.

## Key Features
- **Token Rewards for Mentors**: Mentors can reward learners with tokens based on their interaction and educational support.
- **Transparent Transactions**: Every token transfer is publicly recorded, ensuring transparency.
- **Decentralized**: The contract is deployed on a blockchain, removing intermediaries and ensuring the integrity of the reward system.
- **Incentivization of Education**: Learners are motivated to engage with mentors and progress in their learning journey to earn tokens.
- **Simple Token Economy**: A basic ERC-20 token system that can easily be integrated with other platforms.
